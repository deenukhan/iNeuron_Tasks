    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "Ans : True and False which represent 1 and 0 consecutively , we write them var1 = True, var2 = False\n",

    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "Ans : and, or, not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "Ans : Below Tables are self-explanatory , for and operator if both the values are True then only result will be true, for or operator if any of the values are True then result will be True, for not operator it’s just opposite.  \n",
